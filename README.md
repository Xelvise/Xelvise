## Node.js Backend Engineer ðŸ‘‹

Pragmatic engineer, with a track record of transforming prototypes into robust scalable services. 
I develop production-fit APIs and reliable server-side systems that teams can ship and operate with confidence.

### Preambles from my journey

I started out with Python (data & ML) and evolved into backend engineering, QA, and production APIs. I have designed and shipped end-to-end services (TypeScript, Express/Nest, SQL/NoSQL), implemented secure auth patterns, and built resilient serverless workflows and background jobs. I care deeply about developer experience â€” clear migrations, Docker Compose for local dev, observability, and defensive features (rate limiting, input validation).

### Key projects â€” my strengths ðŸ’ª

- **SubTracka**: A production-fit subscription API featuring lifecycle modeling, multi-currency billing, scheduled renewal reminders (email/webhooks), background job resilience, and serverless deployment.
See [here](https://github.com/Xelvise/SubTracka)

- **DevQuora â€” Developer Q&A forum**: A developer-focused Q&A forum with auth, posting/answering, tagging, voting, search-friendly feeds, rate-limiting, and notification hooks â€” built for integration and scale.

### Areas of expertise

- **Backend**: Express.js, Nest.js, TypeScript, RESTful API design, Websockets, Microservices.

- **SQL/NoSQL Databases**: Redis, PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM, MongoDB + Mongoose, Schema & query design for reads/writes.

- **Auth & Security**: JWT, refresh token patterns, secure credential handling.

- **Serverless & Background job**: AWS Lambda patterns, idempotent webhook handlers, queued jobs (reliability-first).

- **DevOps / DX**: Docker Compose, migrations, environment management, observability and rate-limiting (Redis)

- **Product-minded engineering**: Designing operable systems (not just prototypes), resilient features, and clean APIs for integration.

- **Complementary skills**: QA/testing mindset, data/ML background, front-end integration awareness.
